The rising importance of the open RISC-V architecture, with its modular and license-free nature, is positioning itself as a competitive alternative to proprietary architectures usch as ARM, especially in academic and research environments where customization is key. In this context, \text{hardware} simulations are used to validate architectures' design validation, as the X-HEEP project does, reducing the time-to-market as they speed up the development cycles. To maintain general, real-time control of the platform, the use of RTOS is currently crucial, allowing designers a simple overall management. In this work, the development of a hardware accelerator design for a computational task will be adressed, validated through hardware simulations and managed globally by an RTOS.
